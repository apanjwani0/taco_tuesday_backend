# The Taco Tuesday API

### What is this Preposterous Project?
This started as a Google Sheets calculator, and ended up being a fully-functional, Spring Boot backend.
The Taco Tuesday API provides the employees of a small office in Texas with the ability to manage, track, create, and poll taco orders that they religiously place every Tuesday.

### ... Why?
I'll get back to you on that.

### Stack
The Taco Tuesday API (gosh that's long) utilizes the following super-neat technologies:
- [Spring Boot](https://spring.io/projects/spring-boot)
  - [JPA Repositories](https://docs.spring.io/spring-data/jpa/docs/1.5.0.RELEASE/reference/html/jpa.repositories.html)
- [Maria DB](https://mariadb.org/)
- [The H2 Database Engine](https://www.h2database.com/)
- [Swagger 2](https://spring.io/projects/spring-boot)
- [Maven](https://maven.apache.org/)

### Contribution & Timeline
Crazy enough to care about something so silly?
Feel free to check out the project's progression on its [Kanban](https://trello.com/b/eS2IHPfc/taco-tuesday-api) over at Trello.

### Building & Deploying
Maybe one day!
